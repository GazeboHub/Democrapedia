Structural Plan - Demopcrapedia - Overiew
=====================================

# Overview of Principles

## Core Concepts

* Constitutional Democracy
* Legally Public Information
* Intended to start from a foundation of _no partisan agendas_, with
  regards to democratic principles and presentation of structural
  information
* Inspired by Chile's own _[Poderopedia][poderopedia]_

## Information Model

* Statistical Data
* Structural Data
* Presentational Work

# Structural Plan for Demopedia Core Ontologies

Demopedia will be structured around a simple set of core ontologies,
including:
* [FOAF][foaf]
* [OWL-Time][owl-time]
* [Vocab-Org][vocab-org]
* [SKOS][skos]

Concering the [Bio][bio-vocab] ontology:
* The concept of a _relation_ - rather than given a first-order class
  - may be modeled implicitly, as with OWL object properties
* Formal specifications for _Org_([[Vocab-Org][vocab-org]]) and _Time_
  ([[OWL-Time][owl-time]]) ontologies are available, and will be
  preferred by the Democrapedia project


# Structural Plan for Development of Demopedia Ontologies

1. Ontology of the National Area and Federal Governmental Structure

2. Ontology of State Areas and Governmental Structures

3. Ontology of Counties, Metro Areas, Cities, and Townships

4. Ontology of Outlying Regions

* Guam, Phillipenes, other island regions
* US activity in Antarctica
    * review resources published by the US State Department, regarding
      the continent, Antarctica, history of territorial claims, and
      contemporary science research activities, keeping in mind the
      level of scientific international cooperation demonstrated on
      the Antarctic continent, as well as perhaps analogously aboard
      the ISS
            * US State Department publiations aout Antarctica include:
                * _[Antarctica, Country Specific Information](http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_5173.html)_
                * _[Ocean and Polar Affairs - Antarctic](http://www.state.gov/e/oes/ocns/opa/c6528.htm)_

5. Ontology of Native American Reservations and Tribes

(National Atlas; BIA information resources; histories of treaties;
official tribal resources online - respectful of tribal leaders'
traditional views of knowledge and of tribal identity, of contemporary
concerns of indigenous peoples, and of contemporary commerce and
communication at tribal boundaries)

# Other Notes

* As far as organizational management of Demopedia and her
  development, consider the new type of corporation recently
  instituted in the state of Delaware (policies, guidelines, details)
  - namely, Delaware' new _Public Benefit Corporation_ model - but see
  also, Wahington's _Social Purpose Corporation_ law, c.f
  [selections bookmarked and annotated at diigo](https://www.diigo.com/user/spchamp/%22Social%20Entrepreneurialism%22)
* Consider Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia, as a perhaps more
  discursive and more broadly focused knowledge resource. Concerning
  the nature of existing work in extending Wikipedia with _Web 3.0_
  technologies (as _viz a viz_ Dbpedia) observe those as possibly
  defining an interface for web service integration, with a focus in
  regards to OWL, SPARQL, and the topically focused Demopedia core
  ontologies
* With regards to the _Structural Plan for Development of Demopedia
  Ontologies_, denoted in the previous, begin a survey of resources
  published by the US Library of Congress, the National Atlas, the US
  Census Bureau, the Congress, and any federal agencies that may
  assist in defining, for purpose of citizen information and review,
  the structure of the US federal bureaucracy.
* Survey the resources of the US Department of Treasury, SEC, and
  other federal agencies for public information with regards to
  establishment of publicly traded companies and NGOs. (The
  Moody/Mergesant profiles of publicy traded corporations, namely, may
  seem like an unlikely resource, but possibly consider those for
  reference with regards to specially focused ontologies and the
  public registry, in later works, after the development of the
  Demopedia core ontologies)
* Survey the works of citizen-driven watchdog organizations for
  possible definition of service integration interfaces (cf. SoaML)
* Begin developing a solid and comprehensive TOS and EULA framework
  (cf. [Docracy](http://www.docracy.com/), _viz._ ontologies of legal
  policy and legal practice,
  as discussed
  [at the Cornell University LI web log](http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/category/legal-ontologies/))
* Incorporate (if taking that approach to the concept, must first
  develop a _corporate board_)
* "Do that democracy thing"
* Consider defining web-available _services_ and related SoaML
  _service models_ for public publication, such that those services
  may be (in a sense of service-oriented architecture) _consumed_ by
  other services functioning in _the public web_
* Before integrating any third-party web services and content into
  Demopedia, ensure that the integration is firtly backed by clear
  information about the _licensing policy_ of each such information
  service and any information provided from the same - as at time of
  initial service integration, and at any later time during a
  service's incorporation in Demopedia, such that the _licensing
  policy_ of the third-party service or its information may be updated
  at that later time (Consider, as regarding the design of Demopedia
  services and structure, developing a system of _consensus-oriented
  license review_, _license registration_ and _license update
  notification_, such that Demopedia staff may mutually review the
  license policies of third party information services and any updates
  to the same, concerning the initial integration and any continuing
  integration of said information and information services, within the
  Demopedia public knowledgebase.)
* Ensure that Demopedia will be developed, consistently, with a
  reasonably concise and yet principally comprehensive legal policy
  (Note: No _manifestos_. Try to keep it politically neutral and -
  though the legal policy and other works within Demopedia structure
  and activity must be necessarily comprehensive and structured, in
  regards to pragmatic details - nonetheless, try to keep it
  pragmatically concise and pragmatically relevant to Demopedia
  principles and practice)
