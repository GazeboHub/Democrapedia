Democropedia - Ontologies - Governmental Structure (US)
=======================================================

## Overview - Scope

Democrapedia shall define a series of ontologies for purpose of denoting  structural governmental concepts and representative entities within US federal, US other-regional[1], state, county, and municipal governmental jurisdictions. That set of ontologies shall be referred to as the US Structured Government (SGov) ontologies. 

## Definitive Works

The first prototype of the SGov ontologies was developed using a UML model, in an informal analysis of personal, common knowledge with regards to governmental structure and structural relations in the US.

### Definitive Works in SGov Prototype 1

In the intial prototype of the SGov ontologies, it has been a primary goal to illustrate that the balanced federal "Three branches" model is reified within more localized jurisdictions, so local as the municipality having a city council (essentially fulfilling a legislative role), a mayor's office, a police department (whether formally as an executive department or as an extension of regional judicial office), any executive departments managed under the mayor's office or other municipal agency, and municipal and/or county courts. 

A secondary goal in the design of SGov Prototype 1 has been to begin to illustrate classes of institutions and other entities (e.g region) and entity relations, for purpose of defining an edition of SGov Prototype 1 in modular OWL ontologies, namely

1. Federal Module
2. for each federally recognized indigenous tribe (cf. National Atlas) and each outlying region (cf. FIPS codes?) one region-specific module
3. for each state, one state-specific module
4. for each county in each state (cf. National Atlas) one county-specific module (Fixme: Are there analogous structures within tribes and outlying regions?)
5. for each municipality in each county (cf. National Atlas and DE-9IM) one municpality-specific module
6. to be accompanied with procedural documentation and formal tool application models, for re-application after changes in initial models (cf. National Atlas, Geotools, Apache Ant)

### Towards Later Revisions of the SGov Ontologies

Once the federal module for SGov Prototype 1 may be defined in OWL format, the SGov federal ontology may be extended as onto coverage of congressional bills and bill process, executive departments and their formal publications, and judicial activity in the SCOTUS.

The remaining SGov modular ontologies, for purpose of brevity, maynbe referenced singularly onto Wikipedia. 

It is a goal of the Democrapedia project: To develop a discrete refernce chain within all Democrapedia ontologies. Democrapedia shall seek formal, legally public, primary works of reference in developing the SGov ontologies, and shall denote those works of reference within all derived assertions, within the SGov ontologies.

## Documentation

The SGov ontologies shall be described with UML class diagrams and OWL entity metadata.

(To Do: This may be accompanied with the development of an ODM OWL module for Modelio, and/or an ODM OWL module for Eclipse Papyrus)

## Use Cases

### Overview of Congressional Comittees and Comittee Actions

If the collected works of Congress would be viewed only at the level of individual bills entered into the Congresional process, it may present simply an overwhelming "lot of text." When, rather, the works of Congress would be viewed as in a context of actions within individual Congressional committees - including actions directly with regards to legislative bills and other committee activities - then the Congressional process and the Congressional record may be more apparent for its topically and conceptually relevant qualities.

(Maybe it could be viewed as like an "Adopt a Committee" program, although Congress might be nonplussed by such a concept)

### Overview of State Legislative Comittees and Comittee Actions

(See also: The federal model)

### Overview of Judicial Appointment

(Courts do work, too)

### Structured Documentation of Federal Institutions and Institutional Relations

(This is "The big fish". Correspondance to Captain Ahab, pending)

### Citizen "Watchdog" View of Public Records Describing Works of Lobbying Towards Legislative, Judicial, and Executive Offices

(as far as lobbying towards judicial offices: Citation needed, cf. news summer 2013)

### Educational Roles of SGov Structured Ontology Views

(cf. School - where one may begin to learn how the government is structured, if not also why the government's structure is relevant, as with regards to matters of state - perhaps also, _why Congress was designed to run slowly_,  like as to prevent transitory revolutions of partisan agenda)

## Footnotes

[1] Those "Other regions" shall include: sovereign indigenous nations and outlying areas such as Guam and Philippines. Care shall be taken to not relegate those "other regions'" governments to the nature of a US State region, but rather to denote those regions' governments for their regional, institutional, and principled sovereignty.
