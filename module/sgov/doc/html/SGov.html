  <h1 id="democropediaontologiesgovernmentalstructureus">Democropedia -
  Ontologies - Governmental Structure (US)</h1>

  <h2 id="overviewscope">Overview - Scope</h2>

  <p>Democrapedia shall define a series of ontologies for purpose of denoting
  structural governmental concepts and representative entities within US
  federal, US other-regional[1], state, county, and municipal governmental
  jurisdictions. That set of ontologies shall be referred to as the US
  Structured Government (SGov) ontologies.</p>

  <h2 id="definitiveworks">Definitive Works</h2>

  <p>The first prototype of the SGov ontologies was developed using a UML
  model, in an informal analysis of personal, common knowledge with regards to
  governmental structure and structural relations in the US.</p>

  <h3 id="definitiveworksinsgovprototype1">Definitive Works in SGov Prototype
  1</h3>

  <p>In the intial prototype of the SGov ontologies, it has been a primary goal
  to illustrate that the balanced federal "Three branches" model is reified
  within more localized jurisdictions, so local as the municipality having a
  city council (essentially fulfilling a legislative role), a mayor's office, a
  police department (whether formally as an executive department or as an
  extension of regional judicial office), any executive departments managed
  under the mayor's office or other municipal agency, and municipal and/or
  county courts.</p>

  <p>A secondary goal in the design of SGov Prototype 1 has been to begin to
  illustrate classes of institutions and other entities (e.g region) and entity
  relations, for purpose of defining an edition of SGov Prototype 1 in modular
  OWL ontologies, namely</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Federal Module</li>

    <li>for each federally recognized indigenous tribe (cf. National Atlas) and
    each outlying region (cf. FIPS codes?) one region-specific module</li>

    <li>for each state, one state-specific module</li>

    <li>for each county in each state (cf. National Atlas) one county-specific
    module (Fixme: Are there analogous structures within tribes and outlying
    regions?)</li>

    <li>for each municipality in each county (cf. National Atlas and DE-9IM)
    one municpality-specific module</li>

    <li>to be accompanied with procedural documentation and formal tool
    application models, for re-application after changes in initial models (cf.
    National Atlas, Geotools, Apache Ant)</li>
  </ol>

  <p>SGov Prototype 1 is pictured below, in its first revision.</p>

  <figure id="item2">
    <img src="SGov_image001.jpg" style="width: 100%;">

    <figcaption>
      <i>SGov Prototype 1, Version 1</i>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <h3 id="towardslaterrevisionsofthesgovontologies">Towards Later Revisions of
  the SGov Ontologies</h3>

  <p>Once the federal module for SGov Prototype 1 may be defined in OWL format,
  the SGov federal ontology may be extended as onto coverage of congressional
  bills and bill process, executive departments and their formal publications,
  and judicial activity in the SCOTUS.</p>

  <p>The remaining SGov modular ontologies, for purpose of brevity, maynbe
  referenced singularly onto Wikipedia.</p>

  <p>It is a goal of the Democrapedia project: To develop a discrete refernce
  chain within all Democrapedia ontologies. Democrapedia shall seek formal,
  legally public, primary works of reference in developing the SGov ontologies,
  and shall denote those works of reference within all derived assertions,
  within the SGov ontologies.</p>

  <h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>

  <p>The SGov ontologies shall be described with UML class diagrams and OWL
  entity metadata.</p>

  <p>(To Do: This may be accompanied with the development of an ODM OWL module
  for Modelio, and/or an ODM OWL module for Eclipse Papyrus)</p>

  <h2 id="usecases">Use Cases</h2>

  <h3 id="overviewofcongressionalcomitteesandcomitteeactions">Overview of
  Congressional Comittees and Comittee Actions</h3>

  <p>If the collected works of Congress would be viewed only at the level of
  individual bills entered into the Congresional process, it may present simply
  an overwhelming "lot of text." When, rather, the works of Congress would be
  viewed as in a context of actions within individual Congressional committees
  - including actions directly with regards to legislative bills and other
  committee activities - then the Congressional process and the Congressional
  record may be more apparent for its topically and conceptually relevant
  qualities.</p>

  <p>(Maybe it could be viewed as like an "Adopt a Committee" program, although
  Congress might be nonplussed by such a concept)</p>

  summer 2013)</p>

  <h3 id="educationalrolesofsgovstructuredontologyviews">Educational Roles of
  SGov Structured Ontology Views</h3>

  <p>(cf. School - where one may begin to learn how the government is
  structured, if not also why the government's structure is relevant, as with
  regards to matters of state - perhaps also, <em>why Congress was designed to
  run slowly</em>, like as to prevent transitory revolutions of partisan
  agenda)</p>

  <h2 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h2>

  <p>[1] Those "Other regions" shall include: sovereign indigenous nations and
  outlying areas such as Guam and Philippines. Care shall be taken to not
  relegate those "other regions'" governments to the nature of a US State
  region, but rather to denote those regions' governments for their regional,
  institutional, and principled sovereignty.</p>
